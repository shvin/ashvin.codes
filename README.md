### **What is this?:**
This is the 2nd version of my portfolio website, this time created with a stack to help with future expansion and usability. The tools used are NextJS, ChakraUI, ThreeJS, and Framer Motion.
### **Site Setup (Local):**
To get started with this site, please use the following commands:

1. Run `npm install` at the root of your directory
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the project
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### ***Todo:***
- [ ] Implement a post page that lets me update site visiters with my most recent work
- [ ] Get the 3d model to work as a movable hero section
- [ ] Create a gist for the project detail's page template
